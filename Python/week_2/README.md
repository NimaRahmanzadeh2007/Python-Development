# Week 2 Practices

## [`Decision_Maker.py`](./Decision_Maker.py)

This program asks the user three questions. If the user answers "yes" to all three questions, they are allowed to go to the cinema. If any of the answers are "no," they cannot go to the cinema.

## [`Password_Guess.py`](./Password_Guess.py)

This program sets a default password and gives the user three attempts to guess it. If the user guesses the password correctly within three attempts, they succeed. If they fail to guess the password in three attempts, they are unsuccessful.

## [`Student_Score.py`](./Student_Score.py)

This program takes a student's score as input, which should be a number between 0 and 100. Based on the score, the program rates the student's performance as excellent, good, needs more practice, or very bad.

## [`Traffic_Light_Better.py`](./Traffic_Light_Better.py) or [`Traffic_Light.py`](./Traffic_Light.py)

This program simulates a traffic light. The user inputs one of three colors: red, blue, or yellow. The program then provides the corresponding action for the traffic light color. For example, if the user inputs "red," the program outputs "stop."
